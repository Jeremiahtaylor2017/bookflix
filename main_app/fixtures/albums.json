The title refers to Carti’s affiliation with the Bloods, as well as his affinity for Wockhardt’s red codeine-promethazine syrup, commonly known as lean.\n\nIn a Spring 2019 GQ story published on March 4, Carti named fashion designer and art director Virgil Abloh as the creative director of the album.\n\nIn The FADER’s Summer 2019 cover story featuring Carti that was published on June 12, it was revealed that some tracks recorded during production of the album had guest appearances from Trippie Redd and Gunna, with production from Pi'erre Bourne, Maaly Raw, Richie Souf, Roark Bailey, and Don Cannon.\n\nDuring his performance at The Rave / Eagles Club on July 28, 2019, Carti announced that he was trying to release the album within the following sixty days with no guest appearances:\n\n\"I’m trying to drop that shit in the next 60 days. I ain’t gon' lie, it feel like we worked too hard for this moment so I'ma do this shit with no features.\"\n\nIn an interview with Culture Kings released on January 15, 2020, Carti updated the planned release date to 2020.\n\n“@ MEH” was released as a single for the album on April 16, 2020.\n\nOn November 23, 2020, Carti shared on Instagram that the album had been turned in to his label.\n\nOn December 11, 2020, DJ Akademiks said during a live stream that Kanye West and Matthew Williams were executive producers of the album. Moreover, he shared that the album would drop on Christmas Day, which was later confirmed by some of Carti’s associates on December 14, 2020. Red graffiti tags subsequently surfaced around the United States with the album release date.\n\nOn December 21, 2020, Carti revealed the cover artwork and official Christmas Day release date through social media. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Playboi+Carti/Whole+Lotta+Red\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The track was followed months later by “GNF (OKOKOK)” in February 2021 and the long-awaited “RAPSTAR” in April.\n\nIn early March 2021, Polo reposted an Instagram story speculating the album’s impending release after adding the initials “HOF” to his bio, seemingly accrediting the speculation.

            "summary": "Happier Than Ever is the second studio album by American singer Billie Eilish. It was released on July 30, 2021, by Darkroom and Interscope. Eilish wrote the album with her frequent collaborator, her brother FINNEAS, who produced the album himself. Eilish cited self-reflection during the COVID-19 pandemic as the biggest inspiration for the album.\n\nPrimarily a downtempo pop record, Happier Than Ever is characterized by sparse, jazz-influenced, electropop arrangements set to meditative tempos, departing from the upbeat, trap-led sound of Eilish's debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? (2019). Consisting of torch songs about the downsides of stardom, Happier Than Ever draws heavily from Eilish's rise to fame and the drawbacks that come with it. Upon release, the album received acclaim from music critics, who praised its stylistic, restrained production, and insightful lyrics. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, the album and its title track received a total of seven nominations, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.\n\nSeven singles were released in promotion of the album: \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", \"Your Power\", \"Lost Cause\", \"NDA\", the title track, and \"Male Fantasy\"; the first three peaked within the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100. \"Therefore I Am\" was the highest-charting song from the album, peaking at number two, followed by \"My Future\" at number six, and \"Your Power\" at number 10. Happier Than Ever debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Eilish's second number-one album in the United States, and topping the album charts in 27 other countries. A Disney+ documentary concert film, Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles, was released on September 3, 2021 and received a nomination for Best Music Film at the 2022 Grammys. To promote the album further, Eilish embarked on her fifth concert tour, titled Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, set to cover Europe, Oceania and North America in 2022.\n\nUpon release, Happier Than Ever received acclaim from music critics, who admired its resolute portrayal of teenage stardom contrasting its muted sound. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from publications, the album has a weighted mean score of 86 based on 27 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Eilish/Happier+Than+Ever\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album, titled after a fictional planet created by Doja Cat, sees the artist experimenting with sounds that were new and unfamiliar to her, in an attempt to depart from the mainstream trends expected of pop artists. To further explain the name, she likened her musical style's shift in the record to travelling outside of Earth and into outer space.\n\nA record that explores and incorporates a wide variety of genres, Planet Her is an amalgamation of pop, R&B and hip hop styles. Lyrically, the album touches on several topics and themes, focusing on femininity, solitude, romance and sexual relationships.\n\nThe album has spawned five singles: \"Kiss Me More (feat. SZA)\", \"You Right\" with The Weeknd, \"Need to Know\", \"Woman\" and \"Get Into It (Yuh)\". The first four songs all charted within the top 15 of both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. Planet Her reached number one in New Zealand and spent four non consecutive weeks at number two on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. Landing inside the top ten in a dozen other countries, it finished 2021 as the tenth best-selling album worldwide. It also broke the record for the biggest opening day for an album by a female rapper on Spotify.\n\nUpon release, Planet Her was met with generally positive reviews from music critics, most of whom praised Doja Cat's musical versatility and her vocal deliveries. The album was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, while \"Need to Know\" was nominated for Best Melodic Rap Performance. The single \"Kiss Me More\" received nominations for Record of the Year, and Song of the Year, and won the award for Best Pop Duo\/Group Performance. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Doja+Cat/Planet+Her\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The elastic bounce of “Funk Aspirin,” with George Clinton, brings a euphoric comparsa aboard the Funkadelic mothership, while a swirling melange of rumba and sticky bass lines provide a rich sonic canvas for veteran rapper Lupe Fiasco’s nimble word play. Loving nods to Afro-Cuban percussion abound on “No Me Alcanza,” performed with Havana legends Los Papines, while the saturated synths of “Estoy Pa’ Eso” wink at Sign O’ the Times-era Prince. Cimafunk’s roots act as a prismatic lens of musical memory, refracting strife and indefatigable Cuban resilience across the album, most emphatically on the resistance anthem",

Through her melodious soundscapes built for deep thinking, the Colombian multihyphenate shapes a narrative of a “broken” girl — reflected in the album title, aesthetic, and lyrics — and carefully lays out the internal battles that come with the experience. She strays from commercial pop reggaeton, opting instead for soft undertones of nu-funk, experimental instrumentation, and sequence selections that hold her stories together. Tracks such as “Niñxs Rotxs” are rooted in self-reflection, while “Ashé” and “WOW” act as powerful reclamations of pro-Black protests.",

In an interview about recording his debut studio album, So Much Fun (2019), Young Thug told The Fader that he wanted to release a follow-up album in the \"upcoming weeks\". In contrast to his debut, which he described as a \"lighthearted work\", Punk would be more personal and introspective. He implied that the new album was \"touching\" and interpreted the meaning of Punk as \"brave, not self centered, conscious, very, very neglected, very misunderstood, very patient, very authentic\". He said the album would reflect \"real rap\". On July 27, 2021, Thug featured on an NPR Tiny Desk home concert, where he performed four new songs and teased an October 15 release date for the album, as seen on the back of his t-shirt. More promotion for Punk is a video published on October 13, 2021, of Thug smashing a $320,000 Rolls-Royce with the word \"punk\" painted on it in pink. Following Punk’s release, Thug stated during his appearance on The Breakfast Club that his track \"Day Before\" with Mac Miller was recorded on the day before Miller's death on September 7, 2018. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Young+Thug/PUNK\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

But When Smoke Rises is much more than a collection of devastating ballads, though it’s also that: the 24-year-old used the record as a staging ground for his playful, striking colliding of genres and traditions, from sparse piano torch singing and folk strumming to hip-hop and spoken-word sound collages. But what remains most striking about this immaculate debut is Mustafa’s arresting, quivering vocals and his gut-punch portrayal of grief so all-encompassing that, as he sings on “Capo,” he can’t even scrub it off in the shower.

In November 2020, Jordan spent 45 days in a rehab facility in Arizona, an experience she references directly in \"Ben Franklin\".\n\n\"Valentine\" received critical acclaim upon release, earning a Metacritic score of 88/100 and the 'Best New Music' certification by Pitchfork. Olivia Horn of Pitchfork wrote that Jordan \"flirts with pop—sharpening her hooks, reaching for the synths and strings\", in contrast to the \"limited possibilities of a three-piece rock band\" on her previous album \"Lush\". Horn rated the album 8.5/10, stating that Jordan's songwriting was \"dazzlingly sharp and passionate\". In a glowing review for NME, El Hunt wrote that \"Jordan's songwriting is as astute as ever, and her exploration of love here is set to a rich palette of explorative strings and synths\", rating the album 5 stars out of 5. Writing for AllMusic, Marcy Donelson gave the album 3.5 starts out of 5, arguing that while Valentine represents a \"bold musical step\" for Jordan, it nevertheless \"leaves some of her distinctiveness behind.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Snail+Mail/Valentine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Still Over It  is the second studio album by American singer Summer Walker, released on November 5, 2021, by LVRN and Interscope. On the two-year anniversary of her debut album, Walker announced the release of Still Over It through a video teaser. \nStill Over It charts a journey through a messy and complicated breakup. Walker wants you to know she’s singing about her ex-boyfriend and the father of her child, noted Atlanta producer London on da Track. London not only contributes production to half of the album; he’s also the subject of Walker’s lyrical anguish. Her sadness and insecurities aren’t theoretical, and her songwriting is most powerful when she’s descriptive about the depths of that agony: “How could you make me spend my whole fucking pregnancy alone?”\n\nWalker and London aren’t the album’s only contributors, nor the only characters in its story. Opening track “Bitter” is a hazy stream of consciousness where Walker presumably addresses her social-media spats with the mothers of London’s other children (“So why you puttin’ on for The Shade Room and Insta?” she questions). The track ends with a voicemail from Cardi B, who advises Walker to “put that drama in your music.” Lead single “Ex for a Reason”—featuring City Girls’ JT and co-produced by Sean Garrett—shines with a sleek hook and bubbly production reminiscent of Garrett’s early-2000s hits. On the pop-infused “No Love,” Walker and SZA regret defending a man who isn’t worth it: “Tried to act like I wasn’t good enough in your eyes\/Funny now that you callin’, that you ringin’ my line,” Walker sings. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Summer+Walker/Still+Over+It\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

To accompany Don’t Go Tellin’ Your Mama, Jones co-directed an impressive short film that delineates in visual terms — short performances, interviews with elders like Black Thought, and archival video clips — how the modern Black experience eludes simple stereotypes while updating community traditions.",

This is also their second double album, and their first studio album since Powerslave (1984) to have no songwriting contributions from guitarist Dave Murray in any way, as well as the first since Virtual XI (1998) to feature multiple songs written by bassist Steve Harris alone.\n\nThe name of the album is rendered on the right side of the cover art by the actual vertical Japanese spelling of \"senjutsu\" (戦術), and on the left side by a font reminiscent of Japanese characters.\n\nCritical reception:\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album has an average score of 86 based on 14 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Wall of Sound scored the album 9/10, calling it an \"epic and triumphant return for the lads... better balanced ... with some interesting songwriting\".\n\nSenjutsu is one of Iron Maiden's most successful albums, chart-wise, to date peaking at number one in numerous countries such as Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy, Scotland, Sweden and Switzerland, and marked their first album not to peak that position in the UK charts since A Matter of Life and Death (2006); it did, however, top the UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts. The album also gave the band its highest chart position in the US at number three.\n\nArtwork:\nThe album Senjutsu marks the second use of the band's original logotype (with the extended letters R, M and N) on a studio album cover since The X Factor (1995), the previous one being for The Book of Souls (2015).

These rumors were later proved to be inaccurate.\"\n\nOn December 10, 2019, Drake made a guest appearance at DaBaby’s concert in Toronto, where he revealed that he was working on the album:\n\n\"I’ma go back to the crib and try to finish this album up so we can turn up in 2020.\"\n\nOn May 1, 2020, Drake dropped his fifth solo mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes as a precursor to his sixth album.
