I’m trying to prove to these folks that I can rap. I got bars. That’s what Whole Lotta Red is about.\"\n\nThe album title was discovered on August 18, 2018, when a recording of Carti surfaced, in which he was conversing about the project. The title refers to Carti’s affiliation with the Bloods, as well as his affinity for Wockhardt’s red codeine-promethazine syrup, commonly known as lean.\n\nIn a Spring 2019 GQ story published on March 4, Carti named fashion designer and art director Virgil Abloh as the creative director of the album.\n\nIn The FADER’s Summer 2019 cover story featuring Carti that was published on June 12, it was revealed that some tracks recorded during production of the album had guest appearances from Trippie Redd and Gunna, with production from Pi'erre Bourne, Maaly Raw, Richie Souf, Roark Bailey, and Don Cannon.\n\nDuring his performance at The Rave / Eagles Club on July 28, 2019, Carti announced that he was trying to release the album within the following sixty days with no guest appearances:\n\n\"I’m trying to drop that shit in the next 60 days. I ain’t gon' lie, it feel like we worked too hard for this moment so I'ma do this shit with no features.\"\n\nIn an interview with Culture Kings released on January 15, 2020, Carti updated the planned release date to 2020.\n\n“@ MEH” was released as a single for the album on April 16, 2020.\n\nOn November 23, 2020, Carti shared on Instagram that the album had been turned in to his label.\n\nOn December 11, 2020, DJ Akademiks said during a live stream that Kanye West and Matthew Williams were executive producers of the album. Moreover, he shared that the album would drop on Christmas Day, which was later confirmed by some of Carti’s associates on December 14, 2020. Red graffiti tags subsequently surfaced around the United States with the album release date.\n\nOn December 21, 2020, Carti revealed the cover artwork and official Christmas Day release date through social media. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Playboi+Carti/Whole+Lotta+Red\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The track was followed months later by “GNF (OKOKOK)” in February 2021 and the long-awaited “RAPSTAR” in April.\n\nIn early March 2021, Polo reposted an Instagram story speculating the album’s impending release after adding the initials “HOF” to his bio, seemingly accrediting the speculation. The project is expected to drop in the coming months following the release of Polo’s collaboration with Lil Durk and The Kid LAROI. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Polo+G/Hall+of+Fame\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "summary": "Happier Than Ever is the second studio album by American singer Billie Eilish. It was released on July 30, 2021, by Darkroom and Interscope. Eilish wrote the album with her frequent collaborator, her brother FINNEAS, who produced the album himself. Eilish cited self-reflection during the COVID-19 pandemic as the biggest inspiration for the album.\n\nPrimarily a downtempo pop record, Happier Than Ever is characterized by sparse, jazz-influenced, electropop arrangements set to meditative tempos, departing from the upbeat, trap-led sound of Eilish's debut album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? (2019). Consisting of torch songs about the downsides of stardom, Happier Than Ever draws heavily from Eilish's rise to fame and the drawbacks that come with it. Upon release, the album received acclaim from music critics, who praised its stylistic, restrained production, and insightful lyrics. At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, the album and its title track received a total of seven nominations, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.\n\nSeven singles were released in promotion of the album: \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", \"Your Power\", \"Lost Cause\", \"NDA\", the title track, and \"Male Fantasy\"; the first three peaked within the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100. \"Therefore I Am\" was the highest-charting song from the album, peaking at number two, followed by \"My Future\" at number six, and \"Your Power\" at number 10. Happier Than Ever debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Eilish's second number-one album in the United States, and topping the album charts in 27 other countries. A Disney+ documentary concert film, Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles, was released on September 3, 2021 and received a nomination for Best Music Film at the 2022 Grammys. To promote the album further, Eilish embarked on her fifth concert tour, titled Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, set to cover Europe, Oceania and North America in 2022.\n\nUpon release, Happier Than Ever received acclaim from music critics, who admired its resolute portrayal of teenage stardom contrasting its muted sound. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from publications, the album has a weighted mean score of 86 based on 27 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Eilish/Happier+Than+Ever\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
